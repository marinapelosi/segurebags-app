# Secure Bags App

In summary, a component was created that can be used in tons of contexts, passing parameters as props. For example, if you want a list of Lenders, you just need to instance the component as much as you want, even when you need a .map() to treat all Lenders that could come from a database.

```<LenderCard />```




### To Run
